# Contributing to Sikemux

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. Sikemux is a Tauri + Rust + React desktop app; this guide gets you from a clean clone to a green PR.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable), Node.js 22+, and pnpm 10.33.0 (the version pinned in `package.json`). macOS bundles require Xcode; Windows development requires Microsoft C++ Build Tools and WebView2. Published releases target Apple Silicon. Windows is not a current target and CI no longer builds or tests it, so the NSIS installer is best-effort and only as good as the last manual `pnpm build:windows` on a Windows machine.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nodelike/sikemux.git
cd sikemux
pnpm install        # also points core.hooksPath at .githooks
pnpm tauri dev      # hot-reload Vite + Tauri on macOS or Windows
```

`pnpm install` installs a `pre-push` hook that runs the CI gates for whatever you
are about to push. Install it by hand in an existing clone with `make hooks`.

## Project layout

| Path                  | What lives there                                                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/`                | React UI: components, Zustand state, editor, terminal, themes, keymap      |
| `src/state/commands/` | Every action that changes app state, one module per area                   |
| `src/api/`            | Thin wrappers over Tauri `invoke` commands                                 |
| `src/plugin-api/`     | The only part of the app a plugin's frontend may import                    |
| `src/plugins/`        | Plugin frontends (AWS, Bitbucket, Bruno, GitHub, Rundeck, SigNoz)          |
| `src-tauri/src/`      | Rust core: PTY, git, LSP, file watchers, browser tabs, agents, diagnostics |
| `src-tauri/crates/`   | Shared Rust crates: plugin API, process runner, keychain, markdown         |
| `src-tauri/plugins/`  | Plugin backends, one crate per plugin behind a Cargo feature               |
| `browser/`            | Agent tool declarations (`tools.json`) and the guide agents read           |
| `showcase/`           | Demo data and scenes for README and site screenshots                       |
| `scripts/`            | Code generators, CI checks, icon pipeline and release tooling              |
| `docs/architecture/`  | How the app fits together, and the decisions behind it                     |

Read [the architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) before a large change, and the decision records beside it before proposing to undo one.

## Before you open a PR

The `pre-push` hook already runs these for you. To check without pushing:

```bash
make prepush          # the CI gates, limited to what your commits touched
make check            # every gate, regardless of what changed
pnpm build            # production frontend build
```

`make check` runs Prettier in check mode, ShellCheck, ESLint, TypeScript, frontend tests with coverage, the performance budget, `cargo audit`, `cargo fmt --check`, Clippy with warnings denied, Rust tests, and credential-free release-tooling checks. It also checks that generated files (IPC contracts, agent tools, grammars) match their sources. These are the same quality gates enforced by CI.

Some gates are floors that only move one way. Raise them when you beat them; never lower them to get a change through:

- **Test coverage:** the thresholds in `vite.config.ts` under `test.coverage.thresholds`. When a change lifts coverage, set each threshold to the new measured value, rounded down.
- **`!important` in CSS:** the budget in `scripts/check-css-important.mjs`, checked by `pnpm lint`. Remove one and lower the budget to match.
- **Bundle size:** the ceilings checked by `pnpm perf:budget` (see below).

One CI job stays out of the hook: **macOS launched desktop E2E**. Run it with `pnpm test:e2e:desktop` if you touched the launch path — it builds the whole app, so the hook leaves it to CI.

`cargo audit` reads a database that changes daily, so a push that was clean can go red later with no code change. That is the advisory database moving, not your commit.

Skip the hook for a work-in-progress push with `git push --no-verify`, or `SKIP_PREPUSH=1 git push`. Force every gate to run with `PREPUSH_FULL=1`.

Releases publish only from the Release workflow ([docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md)); `scripts/release.sh --publish` refuses to run outside GitHub Actions. Release tooling supports two explicit modes. The default community mode requires the Tauri updater private key but no Apple membership and produces an updater-signed, ad-hoc code-signed release. `RELEASE_NOTARIZED=1` additionally requires a Developer ID and Apple notarization credentials and enforces Gatekeeper and stapled-ticket verification.

Agent tools are declared once in `browser/tools.json`. Add or change one there, run `pnpm agent-tools:generate`, and commit the regenerated `src-tauri/src/generated_agent_tools.rs`. `pnpm agent-tools:check` fails when a declared method has no handler, when a handler is exposed by no tool, or when the generated file is stale. Keep tool descriptions to one line: they are sent on every agent request, so protocol detail belongs in `browser/SIKEMUX_GUIDE.md`, which agents fetch once through `guide`. `pnpm agent-tools:report` prints what the surface currently costs.

`pnpm perf:budget` checks the production bundle after `pnpm build`. Every startup, lazy-feature, total-JavaScript, and CSS ceiling must retain at least 10% reserve; reaching the nominal ceiling is already a failure. When adding substantial UI, prefer a feature-level dynamic import and only rebaseline a ceiling alongside measured bundle output and a documented reason.

- **Scope** — keep PRs focused. One feature or fix per PR is much easier to review.
- **No regressions** — keep things efficient and performant; if a change touches the editor, terminal, or git panes, verify the affected views still behave.

## Screenshots

`pnpm showcase` renders the app in headless Chrome on demo data and writes every scene to `showcase/out/` as a full window, a framed window, and 2x crops. It needs Google Chrome installed. Add `--publish` to refresh the README images, or `--site <dir>` to copy every capture somewhere else. Scenes live in `showcase/scenes.mjs` and the demo data in `showcase/world/`. To click around the same demo app yourself, run `make showcase`; it opens http://localhost:1471/showcase/ in your browser.
