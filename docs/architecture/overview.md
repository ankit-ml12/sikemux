# How Sikemux fits together

A map of the codebase for someone opening it for the first time. The
[README](../../README.md) covers what the app does. [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
covers setup and the checks you run before pushing.
[ADR 0001](./0001-keep-react-tauri.md) explains why the app stays on React and Tauri.

## Processes

Sikemux is a [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) app. Tauri runs a native Rust process that
owns a window. Inside that window, a system web view (WKWebView on macOS) runs the
React interface. The two talk over IPC: the page calls named Rust commands, and Rust
sends events and byte streams back.

| Process                   | Where it lives                                               | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main process              | `src-tauri/src/main.rs` → `lib.rs::run()`                    | Owns every shell, Git call, language server, watcher, agent connection and browser tab. `lib.rs` registers the managed state and every IPC command.                                                                                         |
| App web view              | `src/main.tsx`, window label `main`                          | The React UI. It loads `dist/` in builds and `http://localhost:1420` in dev. A guard in `lib.rs` stops it from ever navigating anywhere else.                                                                                               |
| Browser tabs              | `src-tauri/src/browser/`                                     | Each tab is a native child web view placed over the main window. React draws only the tab chrome and reports where the page area is. `without_page_script.rs` keeps the app's own page scripts out of these tabs.                          |
| `sikemux-editor`          | `src-tauri/src/bin/sikemux-editor.rs` → `cli_client.rs`      | The `sikemux` and `sikemux-editor` command-line launchers. They connect to the running app to open files and projects.                                                                                                                      |
| `sikemux-tools-mcp`       | `src-tauri/src/bin/sikemux-tools-mcp/`                       | The MCP server (Model Context Protocol, how coding agents discover tools) that agents launch over stdio. It forwards each tool call to the app.                                                                                              |
| `sikemux-voice`           | `src-tauri/voice/` (Swift package)                           | Speech-to-text helper. `voice.rs` starts it, writes JSON lines to its stdin and relays what it reports as `voice` events.                                                                                                                   |
| Shells, agents, LSPs      | spawned by `pty/`, `acp/`, `lsp/`                            | Ordinary child processes. When the main web view reloads or the window closes, `lib.rs` drains all of them.                                                                                                                                 |

The helper binaries ship as Tauri sidecars, meaning extra executables bundled next to
the app. `scripts/build-cli-sidecar.mjs` builds the Rust ones into `src-tauri/binaries/`,
`scripts/build-voice-helper.mjs` builds the Swift one, `tauri.sidecar.conf.json` and
`tauri.voice.conf.json` add them to the bundle, and `pnpm sidecar:dev` builds them for dev.

### The CLI broker

`cli_server.rs` listens on a local TCP port guarded by a random token, and writes the
port and token to `~/.config/sikemux/cli.json` (`cli.dev.json` in debug builds). Both
the `sikemux` launcher and `sikemux-tools-mcp` find the app through that file, or
through `SIKEMUX_CLI_ENDPOINT`, which every terminal Sikemux starts receives. File-open
requests reach the UI as a `cli-open-available` event, handled by
`src/shell/CliOpenBridge.tsx`. Agent tool calls go through the harness, described under
[Agents](#agents).

### State

There is one [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) store, `useStore` in
`src/state/store.ts`. Its type is `DomainState & ViewState`: what the user built, and
how it is currently shown. Updates go through `mutate(draft => …)`, which uses Immer
so code can write to a draft instead of copying objects by hand.

Components read the store through selectors (`selectors.ts`) and change it by calling
functions from `src/state/commands/`, imported as `import * as cmd from "./state/commands"`.
That folder is the action layer: if something changes sessions, windows, panes, tabs,
agents or settings, it belongs there, not in a component. `shared.ts` holds helpers such
as `patchWindow` and `withActiveSession`. `bus.ts` is a small in-app event bus for
one-off signals such as `open-file`, `fs-changed` and `pane-closed`.

The objects nest like this (types in `src/state/types/domain.ts`):

```
Session            kind: project | command | ssh | <plugin kind>
└─ Window[]        one tab in the session's strip, with a role: term, files, git, agent, …
   └─ LayoutNode   a tree of SplitNode (row | column | stack) and PaneNode
      └─ PaneNode  kind: terminal | editor | git | diff | search | agent | desk | <plugin kind>
```

A project is a session of kind `project` whose `cwd` is the project root.
`projectRoots` lists the folders Sikemux scans to find projects. Agents live in their
own `agents` record. An agent's window has one pane whose id is the agent's id
(`agentWindow.ts`), so `agents[pane.id]` is its record. Each agent can also have a desk
(`desks`), which holds its browser tabs, the files it opened and its task terminals.

**Persistence.** `persist.ts` watches the store. Shortly after the last change it
serializes a snapshot and sends it through `state_save`. `src-tauri/src/state.rs` writes
it to SQLite at `~/.config/sikemux/state.sqlite3` (`state.dev.sqlite3` in debug, so dev
builds never touch installed state). Loading runs `applyHydrate`, which migrates older
snapshots and validates them with `persistValidation.ts`. The schema version is
`VERSION` in `persist.ts` and must match `APPLICATION_STATE_VERSION` in `state.rs`.

**Resources.** Backend data that is fetched rather than owned, such as Git overviews,
remotes, agent sessions and SSH hosts, goes through `resources.ts`. A definition in
`resources.defs.ts` names a `kind`, a `fetch` function and a `staleAfterMs`. Components
call `useResource(def, ...args)`. The cache shares one request between callers, is
bounded in size, and drops entries nothing has used for a while. `invalidate(predicate)`
refetches whatever matches, which is how file-watcher events refresh the UI.

## IPC

Every module in `src/api/` calls `invoke` from `src/api/invoke.ts`, which records
timing and error counts and supports cancellation through an `AbortSignal`. It
sits on `src/api/transport.ts`. Tests replace that transport with an in-memory one
through `installIpcTransportForTests`, so no test needs a real backend.

**The command list is generated.** Rust commands are registered once, in the
`tauri::generate_handler![…]` list in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.
`pnpm ipc:generate` (`scripts/generate-ipc-contracts.mjs`) reads that list and writes:

- `src-tauri/src/generated_command_names.rs`, which `build.rs` uses to generate a
  permission for each command;
- `src/api/generated/ipcCommands.ts`, the same names as a TypeScript type;
- `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`, which allows exactly those commands for the
  `main` web view and nothing else. Browser tabs get no commands.

After adding or removing a command, run `pnpm ipc:generate` and commit the three files.
`pnpm ipc:check` fails if they are stale.

**Data coming back** uses two mechanisms:

- **Channels** carry streams to one caller. Terminal output is the busiest: each
  PTY (pseudo-terminal, the OS device a shell writes to) keeps its own screen in Rust
  (`vt100`), and `pty_attach` returns that screen plus a channel of raw bytes. The page
  reports progress with `pty_ack`, and Rust pauses reading a shell once too much output is
  unacknowledged. A hidden pane unsubscribes; its shell keeps running. Plugin streams
  and update downloads also use channels.
- **Events** are broadcast to the `main` web view with `emit_to`. Examples:
  `git_changed` from `fs_watch.rs` (the UI invalidates resources and fires `fs-changed`,
  see `subscribeGitChanged` in `App.tsx`), `lsp_diagnostics`, `acp_event`,
  `pty_shell_metadata`, `browser-tabs-changed`, `harness-request` and `voice`.

## Plugins

Plugins are compiled into the app. There is no marketplace and no runtime loading.
The six built-ins are AWS, Bitbucket, Bruno, GitHub, Rundeck and SigNoz. Each has two
halves:

- **Rust:** a crate in `src-tauri/plugins/<name>/` that implements the `Plugin` trait
  from `sikemux-plugin-api`. `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` gives each one a Cargo feature of
  the same name, all on by default, and `src-tauri/src/plugins/builtin.rs` lists them.
  Plugin crates opt in to the workspace Clippy lints that forbid `unwrap`, `expect`,
  `panic` and unchecked indexing, because a panicking plugin takes the whole app down.
- **TypeScript:** a folder in `src/plugins/<name>/` that calls `registerFrontendPlugin`.
  `src/plugins/builtin.ts` imports all six and is the only core file allowed to.

A plugin's frontend imports only `src/plugin-api`, its own folder, and React or
Zustand. `scripts/check-plugin-boundaries.mjs` (part of `pnpm lint`) enforces both
directions. When a plugin needs something from the app, add it to `src/plugin-api`.
Frontend calls reach Rust through `createPluginBackend`, which uses `plugin_call` and
`plugin_stream_start`. A plugin can also offer agent tools, which the MCP server lists
next to the built-in ones. Settings can switch a plugin off (`disabledPlugins`) without
removing it from the build.

## Agents

An agent runs on one of two transports.

- **Terminal.** The agent's own CLI runs in a PTY like any shell (`pty/launch.rs`).
  Sikemux tells its state from the screen (`agent_detection/`) and finds its saved
  sessions on disk (`agents/sessions/<agent>.rs`). Every agent type supports this.
- **Chat (ACP).** [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com), the Agent Client Protocol, is
  JSON-RPC over stdio between an editor and an agent. `src-tauri/src/acp/mod.rs`
  starts the agent, sends prompts and permission answers, and emits `acp_event`.
  Claude and Codex are reached through adapter packages Sikemux installs. OpenCode,
  OMP, Grok and Hermes speak ACP themselves (`acp/native.rs`). `acp/air.rs` adds the
  Claude adapter's background task and subagent updates. On the UI side,
  `src/chat/useAcpSession.ts` and `reducer.ts` turn events into a transcript.
  `CHAT_AGENT_TYPES` in `src/agents/agentLaunch.ts` lists the chat-capable agents, and
  `src/chat/AgentSurface.tsx` switches one agent between chat and terminal views.

**Harness tools.** Agents on both transports get Sikemux's tools through
`sikemux-tools-mcp`. `src-tauri/src/browser/agents.rs` knows how to register it with
each agent host. Tools are declared once in `browser/tools.json`, one-line descriptions
only. The protocol details live in `browser/SIKEMUX_GUIDE.md`, which agents fetch with
the `guide` tool. The MCP binary compiles both files in. A tool call travels:

```
agent → sikemux-tools-mcp → CLI broker → harness.rs
  browser.*                      → browser/tools.rs (Rust)
  plugins.tools / plugins.call   → plugins/agent.rs (Rust)
  everything else                → harness-request event → HarnessBridge →
                                   src/harness/service.ts → harness_reply
```

`pnpm agent-tools:generate` writes `src-tauri/src/generated_agent_tools.rs` and checks
that every declared method has a handler in `browser/tools.rs` or
`src/harness/service.ts`, and that no handler lacks a declaration. The README's
[Agent harness tools](../../README.md#agent-harness-tools) section describes the tools
from the user's side.

## Styling

`src/styles.css` imports the sheets every screen needs, in cascade order. Two matter
most:

- `src/styles/tokens.css` defines type, spacing, radius, elevation and the colour
  ramp. All of it derives from four values the theme bus writes on `:root`, so a new
  theme is one entry in `src/themes/index.ts`.
- `src/styles/modern-shell.css` is the shell's layout and surfaces. It gives every
  `<button>` the `--radius-2` corner.

Large feature sheets are split into small files behind an `@import` file that
bundles them. Add a new file to the bundling file, not to `styles.css`:

| Bundling file                        | Parts                         | Loaded                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `src/styles/git.css`                 | `src/styles/git/`             | at startup                    |
| `src/styles/chat.css`                | `src/styles/chat/`            | by `chat/AgentSurface.tsx`    |
| `src/styles/settings.css`            | `src/styles/settings/`        | by `settings/SettingsPanel.tsx` |
| `src/codehost/codehost.css`          | `src/codehost/styles/`        | by `codehost/components/HostArea.tsx` |
| `src/plugins/rundeck/rundeck.css`    | `src/plugins/rundeck/styles/` | by the Rundeck components     |

Read [DESIGN.md](../../DESIGN.md) before changing anything visual, and the UI rules in
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

## Quality ratchets

These limits only move in one direction. All of them run in `pnpm check` and the
pre-push hook.

| Check                    | Where                                                        | How to move it                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Test coverage            | `test.coverage.thresholds` in `vite.config.ts`               | Raise the numbers after `pnpm test:coverage` shows coverage went up. Never lower them.           |
| `!important` count       | `BUDGET` in `scripts/check-css-important.mjs`                | Lower it when you remove one. Only goes down.                                                    |
| Bundle size              | `scripts/check-performance-budget.mjs`, run by `pnpm perf:budget` after `pnpm build` | Every ceiling needs 10% headroom. Prefer lazy imports; raise a ceiling only with measured output and a stated reason. |
| Plugin boundaries        | `scripts/check-plugin-boundaries.mjs`                        | Not a number: add what a plugin needs to `src/plugin-api`.                                       |
| Generated files          | `pnpm ipc:check`, `pnpm agent-tools:check`, `pnpm grammars:check` | Run the matching `:generate` script and commit its output.                                  |
