# Releasing

Releases publish from the **Release** GitHub Actions workflow, never from a laptop. Commit the version bump and a `RELEASE_NOTES.md` headed `# Sikemux v<version>`, then push the matching tag. Tag a commit already on `main` for a nightly, or on its `release/<major.minor>` branch for stable. Only the owner can push a `v*` tag, so only the owner can start a release:

```bash
make preflight
git tag v0.4.1 && git push origin v0.4.1
```

`make preflight` runs the two checks the pre-push hook does not: it launches the real app the way CI's desktop E2E job does, and builds the DMG against its size limit. Either failing would otherwise surface only in the Release run.

A run is titled with its tag, so the approval names what it will publish, and it stops if the tag disagrees with `package.json`. The workflow reads the version from `package.json`, runs the full CI suite, then builds, verifies, and publishes with `scripts/release.sh`. A prerelease version goes to the nightly channel and any other version to stable. Only one release runs at a time, and each run keeps its built artifacts.

If a release fails before it publishes, fix it and move the tag onto the fix. Only the owner can move a release tag, and moving it starts a fresh run:

```bash
git tag -f v0.4.1 && git push -f origin v0.4.1
```

The workflow takes its signing material from the `release` environment:

| Name                                                                                                                                       | Kind                    | Needed for         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`                                                                          | secret                  | every release      |
| `RELEASE_NOTARIZED`                                                                                                                        | variable, `1` to enable | notarized releases |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` (base64 `.p12`), `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | secrets                 | notarized releases |

Limit the environment's deployment refs to `main`, `release/*`, and `v*` tags, and add yourself as a required reviewer so nothing publishes unapproved.

Run `scripts/release.sh` locally without `--publish` to preview a release: it builds, signs, and verifies everything without touching GitHub.

## Community releases without an Apple Developer membership

The updater and Apple Gatekeeper trust different signatures. By default, `scripts/release.sh` makes a community release. It signs the updater archive with the Tauri updater key and applies an ad hoc code signature to the app and DMG.

Existing community installations can receive in-app updates. Fresh downloads are not notarized by Apple, so macOS may ask you to remove quarantine again. Keep the updater private key secure. Clients reject archives that do not match the public key bundled with the app.

Both channels create a versioned GitHub release holding the build. A stable cut also attaches `latest.json`, which the default channel follows. A nightly cut requires a prerelease semantic version, publishes its release as a prerelease, and repoints the moving `nightly` release that the opt-in Nightly channel follows.

Stable is cut from a `release/<major.minor>` branch and nightly from `main`. A nightly targets whichever version comes next, whether that is a patch, a minor or a major, and a stable release of that version overtakes its nightlies for nightly users too.

A hotfix cut from a release branch claims a version as well. When it claims the one the nightlies are building toward, the Nightly channel moves onto the hotfix, because the updater takes the newest version across both feeds, and loses whatever `main` had that the hotfix did not until a later nightly passes it. Before cutting such a hotfix, publish a nightly at the version after it, so the hotfix lands below the nightlies instead of over them.

## Version numbers

A nightly is a prerelease of the version after the latest stable one. Once a stable `0.x.y` ships, number `main`'s nightlies at the next minor, `0.(x+1).0-nightly.N`, rather than the next patch. Patch hotfixes on the release branch then always land below the nightlies and never take the Nightly channel over.

## Promoting a nightly to stable

A nightly that has been in use becomes stable without anything newer from `main`. On `release/<major.minor>`:

1. A merge commit whose content is exactly that nightly's tagged commit.
2. A commit that sets the stable version in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and the `sikemux` entry in `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, and writes `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for everything since the last stable release.
3. The `v<version>` tag on that commit.

None of this lands on `main`. Commits made to `main` meanwhile stay out of the release.

## Hotfixes

Fix the bug on `main` as usual, then cherry-pick only that commit onto `release/<major.minor>`, bump to the next patch, write short notes and tag it. If `main` has rewritten the code since, make the fix on the release branch instead and redo it on `main`. Never merge a release branch into `main`, or `main` into a release branch for a hotfix.

## Committing to a release branch from the shared checkout

Several agents work in one checkout at once, so never check out `release/*`, stash, or use a worktree. Build the commits from objects with a temporary index and push them by id. Use `${name}:path`, not `$name:path`: zsh reads `:s`, `:h` and the like after a bare variable as modifiers.

Promote a nightly:

```bash
release=release/0.4 nightly=v0.4.3-nightly.6 version=0.4.3
git fetch origin
base=$(git rev-parse "origin/${release}"); src=$(git rev-parse "${nightly}^{commit}")
merge=$(git commit-tree "${src}^{tree}" -p "${base}" -p "${src}" -m "merge: bring ${nightly} onto the ${release#release/} line for v${version}")
export GIT_INDEX_FILE=$(mktemp -u); git read-tree "${merge}"
from=$(git show "${merge}:package.json" | sed -n 's/.*"version": "\(.*\)".*/\1/p')
put() { git update-index --cacheinfo "100644,$(git hash-object -w --stdin),$1"; }
git show "${merge}:package.json" | sed "s/\"version\": \"${from}\"/\"version\": \"${version}\"/" | put package.json
git show "${merge}:src-tauri/tauri.conf.json" | sed "s/\"version\": \"${from}\"/\"version\": \"${version}\"/" | put src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
git show "${merge}:src-tauri/Cargo.toml" | sed "3s/\"${from}\"/\"${version}\"/" | put src-tauri/Cargo.toml
git show "${merge}:src-tauri/Cargo.lock" | awk -v from="${from}" -v to="${version}" 'prev=="name = \"sikemux\"" && $0=="version = \""from"\"" {print "version = \""to"\""; prev=$0; next} {print; prev=$0}' | put src-tauri/Cargo.lock
put RELEASE_NOTES.md < /path/to/notes.md
bump=$(git commit-tree "$(git write-tree)" -p "${merge}" -m "chore(release): prepare v${version}")
rm -f "${GIT_INDEX_FILE}"; unset GIT_INDEX_FILE
git diff --stat "${merge}" "${bump}"   # only the four version fields and the notes
git push origin "${bump}:refs/heads/${release}"
git tag "v${version}" "${bump}" && git push origin "v${version}"
```

Cherry-pick a fix, then bump and tag the same way with the patch version:

```bash
release=release/0.4 fix=<commit on main>
base=$(git rev-parse "origin/${release}")
out=$(git merge-tree --write-tree --merge-base="${fix}^" "${base}" "${fix}") || { echo "${out}"; echo "conflict: fix it on the release branch by hand"; }
picked=$(git commit-tree "${out%%$'\n'*}" -p "${base}" -m "$(git log -1 --format=%B "${fix}")")
```

The push to `release/*` fails unless it fast-forwards, and only the owner may push to these branches or push a `v*` tag.

## Running the release script

```bash
./scripts/release.sh 0.3.5 "Release notes"
./scripts/release.sh 0.4.0-nightly.1 "Nightly notes" --nightly
```

If you have an Apple Developer membership, set `RELEASE_NOTARIZED=1` with the Developer ID and notarization environment variables. The release script then requires a successful Gatekeeper assessment and stapled notarization tickets before it publishes anything.

## Releasing the phone app

The phone app releases on its own schedule from the **Mobile release** workflow, started by a `mobile-v*` tag. Only the owner can create, move or delete one, and like a Mac release it waits for the owner's approval on the `release` environment.

```bash
git tag mobile-v0.1.0-nightly.1 && git push origin mobile-v0.1.0-nightly.1
```

`mobile/app/app.json` holds the plain version, such as `0.1.0`, because iOS refuses anything else. A tag is either that version, which is stable, or that version with `-nightly.N`. The run stops if the tag is not a release of the version in `app.json`.

Android needs a version code that grows with every upload. `app.config.js` derives it from the tag: `0.5.0-nightly.3` is `50003`, and `0.5.0` itself is `50099`, so a stable build always follows its own nightlies. Minor and patch numbers stay below 100, and nightlies below 99. The iOS build number is the same code, and the app reads its release back from it to compare with the oldest version `GET /v1/network` allows.

The run checks the phone app, builds the Rust client with the small `mobile` profile, and builds the APK and the Play app bundle. It refuses either unless it is signed with the Play upload key. It attaches the APK to a GitHub release of the tag, marked a prerelease for a nightly, and never as the latest release: sikemux.com takes its Mac download from that one. The app bundle stays on the run until uploads to Google Play are added.

| Name                      | Kind   | Holds                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE` | secret | the upload keystore, base64                        |
| `ANDROID_UPLOAD_PASSWORD` | secret | its password, which is also the key's own password |

Locally, `pnpm android:release` in `mobile/` signs with the same key: the keystore from `~/.config/sikemux/release/upload.keystore` and its password from the Keychain entry "Sikemux Android upload key".

### Over-the-air updates

A release build also asks `updates.sikemux.com` for newer JavaScript and assets each time it starts, on its own channel: a nightly build on `nightly`, a stable one on `stable`. The **Mobile release** run tells the build its channel through `SIKEMUX_MOBILE_CHANNEL`. Dev builds never update.

Every push to `main` that changes the phone's JavaScript or assets runs the **Mobile update** workflow. One job checks the phone app and exports it with `expo export`; a second, which sees only the exported files, signs the update and sends it to citadel on `nightly`. The signature is checked against `mobile/app/certs/updates-certificate.pem` before anything is sent, and phones refuse an update without it.

An update carries a runtime version, a fingerprint of everything native in the app: the Expo config, native modules and the Rust client's sources. A phone only takes updates with its own build's runtime version, so a change that needs new native code is published but waits for the next build that has it. The run's summary shows the update id and runtime version.

To promote a nightly update to stable, run **Mobile update** by hand with its id. It waits for the owner's approval on the `release` environment and then serves the same signed update on `stable`.

Locally, `node scripts/publish-update.mjs android nightly --dry-run` in `mobile/app` builds and signs an update without sending it, with the key from `UPDATES_SIGNING_KEY`. The key lives at `~/.config/sikemux/release/updates-signing-key.pem`.

| Name                  | Kind   | Environment  | Holds                                |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `UPDATES_SIGNING_KEY` | secret | `production` | the update signing key, PEM          |
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`      | secret | `production` | the `sikemux-deploy` key for citadel |
| `DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS`  | secret | `production` | citadel's host key                   |
| `DEPLOY_HOST`         | secret | `production` | citadel's address                    |
